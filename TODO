TODO:
Split up compiler and runner
Tokenize (Faster than strings comparison)
Rename all variables in bytecode
Add compiler grouping
Add reviving to errors
Add personal scopes
     (organizing for compiler & developer)
Change ++int to int++
Add file opening
     + read/write/binary flags

IDEAS FOR COMPILER:
var never used; no declare
var declared -> delted; no declare
var never changes; pass to where used
math operation, known variables; do math
function never used; no include

for
class
with
as
in
from
repeat
match
case
struct
enum
async

Add cross-endian to bytecode_io
AOT pre-linking for imports (cache held in ~/.minis/cache/)
Memory mapping (virtual memory)
64KB sized packets for custom TCP (delete after use)
pool file handles for closing

type long long (Instead of int, same purpose as C++)

add inline on functions

Strongly typed; explicit preffered; explicit optional

let file = open("test.txt") ? throw NameError("File missing!") : print(file);
