TODO:

Garunteed:
Change ++int to int++
Add file opening
     + read/write/binary flags
inline functions
Make a dev file for making Mini libraries
  Provide low-level functions such as:
    The ability to emit bytecode directly
    Low level keywords
      Is this even possible?




Maybe:
Add compiler grouping
Add personal scopes
Folding
  var never used; no declare
  var declared -> instantly delted; no declare
  var never changes; pass to where used
  math operation, known variables; do math
  function never used; no include

AOT pre-linking for imports (cache held in ~/.minis/cache/)
64KB sized packets for custom TCP (delete after use)

More keywords
for
class
as
in
case
struct
enum
async

type long long (Instead of int, same purpose as C++)

let file = open("test.txt") ? throw NameError("File missing!") : print(file);

Add fallback chain
auto x = input("Hey! Who are you?\n");
int c = x || 233

This will make it so, if x is not int, it will become 233 :3
