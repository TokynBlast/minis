Garunteed:
Add int++ along side ++int
Add file opening
     + read/write/binary flags
inline functions
Make a dev file for making Mini libraries
  Provide low-level functions such as:
    The ability to emit bytecode directly
    Low level keywords
      Is this even possible?

Add a zip library made with [this](https://github.com/PlutoLang/pluto-zip)

Add inline short-ciruct variables
```
int x = 358;
int z = 232;
int y = ( z < 103 ) ? z >>> ( x > 800 ) ? x >>> 900;
```

Add hive variant of list (Use std::hive)

"for" keyword

types:
long
long long
float
double float (just double?)
triBool (std::bool_set from TR2)


Maybe:
Use deque over vector
Add compiler grouping
Add personal scopes
Folding
  var never used; no declare
  var declared -> instantly delted; no declare
  var never changes; pass to where used
  math operation, known variables; do math
  function never used; no include

AOT pre-linking for imports (cache held in ~/.minis/cache/)
64KB sized packets for custom TCP (delete after use)

More keywords
class
as
in
case
struct
enum
async

let file = open("test.txt") ? throw NameError("File missing!") : print(file);

This will make it so, if x is not int, it will become 233 :3
