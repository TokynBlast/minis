Garunteed:
Add int++ along side ++int
Add file opening
     + read/write/binary flags
inline functions
Make a dev file for making Mini libraries
  Provide low-level functions such as:
    The ability to emit bytecode directly
    Low level keywords
      Is this even possible?

Add a zip library made with [this](https://github.com/PlutoLang/pluto-zip)

Add ciruct variables
```
int x = 358;
int z = 232;
int y = ( z < 103 ) ? z >>> ( x > 800 ) ? x >>> 900;
int y = {
  z < 103: z;
  x > 800: x;
  _: {
    print("FATAl");
    exit();
  };
}
```

Seperate multiplication, division, and addition in maths.f08
Move Fortran version down as much as safely possible for compatability

Remove unneded/unsupported parts of fast_io

Add hive variant of list (Use std::hive)

Find a way to implement unsigned bits into Fortran...

"for" keyword

Add program-wide destructor

Standardize fail and pass return

Use explicit wrappers instead of a variant, to get full compile-time converions.

Remove unnecesarry bloat from io_fast

Remove int, in place of Rust-style integers

Implement 256-bit integers using C?

Change to Rust:
  Stack operations
  Built-ins
  Plugin manager

Rather than do 40 byte buffer, we do uint64+buffer, to know where to jump to for afterwards :)

Implement entire logical register in Fortran

Make Var only take Value
   Value holds Type and the actual value
   variables currently hold a Value AND a Type

Julia & Fortran for Physics plugin

Maybe:
Use deque over vector (Or seperate types)
Add compiler grouping
Add personal scopes
Folding
  var never used; no declare
  var declared -> instantly delted; no declare
  var never changes; pass to where used
  math operation, known variables; do math
  function never used; no include

AOT pre-linking for imports (cache held in ~/.minis/cache/)
64KB sized packets for custom TCP (delete after use)

More keywords
class
as
in
case
struct
enum
async

let file = open("test.txt") ? throw NameError("File missing!") : print(file);
