The Avocado is quite simple to use!

Here's a legend to the programming:
	AVC - AVoCado
	CHAR - CHARacter
	IDE - Integrated Development Environment
	VAR - VARiable
	V - Version
	S - Style
	UW - UnknoWn
	EX - EXample
	... - code

If you want to change the prefrences on how to use the Avocado, open up pref, and change it to either True or False
Here is a guide to what everything does! and what you can set it to!:

    1. Prompt Character - Shows up on line for command input
	  2. Opened Before - boolean, first letter capitalized
    3. Terminal Default Color - HEX code, without #

Lets get to the basics...
Depending on which variation you have, you will have either 'Avocado.py', or 'Avocado.exe'
They both do the EXACT same thing, run youre new AVC!
Double click the Avocado file, or right click and press run

IF you do not have Python installed on youre device already, you will need to install it.

avocado is open-sourced!
A random knight in this guide: Who is this open-sourced you speak of? Is thy a WIZARD... Harry?
Open-sourced just means you can add to or modify the source code, make youre OWN avocado, fix bugs, or EVEN make it better!

Avocado History

The first Unofficial Avocado (it was a puzzle game) came out before November 8th, and after October 31st, but even then, the first avocado wasnt actually finished, the working AVC IDE that came with it had many bugs, the source code was terribley formatted, and there were MANY errors.
The first OFFICIAL avocado, v0.0.0.1 sI came out on November 8th, 2023 at 5:22 PST
Avocado v0.0.0.1 sI - November 11th, 2023 at [time] PST
From here on, we will call the first OFFICIAL Avocado the 'first avocado'
The first avocado came with some basic features, saving, printing text, replacing, clearing the screen and memory, list, run, quit,and this guide.
The first Avocado was also based off of the Apple ][ (2), even this guide is heavily based off of the Applesoft Basic Guide!
